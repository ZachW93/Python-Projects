Iris Identification
<p>Using Python, are we able to identify two different types of Irises given data of the two Irises?</p>

<p>This project utilizes the Perceptron Algorithm in Machine Learning. Given a dataset consisting of sepal length, petal length, and the actual type of Iris, the program has the ability to create a linear distinction
    between two different Iris types, <b>Setosa</b> and <b>Versicolor</b>. Given a dataset of 100 lines, the goal of this project is to reduce the amount of epochs (iterations through the program) such that the program outputs at 0 errors (or misclassifications).</p>

<p>Before we jump into the project/code itself, below are the python libraries required to run this project (This is done in Python 3.7).
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>As mentioned above, three libraries will be required to run this project, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

<br>
In addition to the libraries, we will need the dataset of the Iris' which can be found <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris">here</a> at UCI's Machine Learning Repository.</p>
