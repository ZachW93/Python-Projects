Iris Identification
Using Python, are we able to identify two different types of Irises given data of the two Irises?

Iris
This project utilizes the Perceptron Algorithm in Machine Learning. Given a dataset consisting of sepal length, petal length, and the actual type of Iris, the program has the ability to create a linear distinction between two different Iris types, Setosa and Versicolor. Given a dataset of 100 lines, the goal of this project is to reduce the amount of epochs (iterations through the program) such that the program outputs at 0 errors (or misclassifications).

Getting Started
Before we jump into the project/code itself, below are the python libraries required to run this project (This is done in Python 3.7).

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
Prerequisites
As mentioned above, three libraries will be required to run this project, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

In addition to the libraries, we will need the dataset of the Iris' which can be found here at UCI's Machine Learning Repository.
