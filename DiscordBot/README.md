Discord Bot

This is a program that works directly with the Discord API to display a "bot" in a live server. This bot has a few commands such as simple math commands, an imgur API command that will display a picture from the subreddit "BikiniBottomTwitter", and a magic 8-ball. A lot of new commands will be added in the future.

Getting Started

To utilize the program, you will need an API Key from both Imgur and Discord. These can be found in their developer sections at https://apidocs.imgur.com/?version=latest and https://discord.com/developers
